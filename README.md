# Student-List-with-file-managment :file_folder:

## Description
This program was created to manage student objects through a list. When the program is terminated, the data on the list is saved in an external file.  If you run again the program, when the list is initialized, the data on the external file is loaded into the list.

I use c++ because is one of the easiest programming languages to manage files. 

## Features

- Add
